# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

My motivation was to learn all the steps involved in creating my own webpage. I built this project using the guidelines from the pre-work modules from my bootcamp to refer back to and get hands on experience in software development. I learned exactly what html, CSS and Javascript was and how they work together to create the webpages we all use on a day to day basis.
